# [Compiling MicroPython for ESP32](https://medium.com/@alwint3r/compiling-micropython-for-esp32-85cc1968e424)
- Alwin Arrasyid / Nov 19, 2017

- MicroPython is an implementation of Python 3 programming language that is optimized to run on a microcontroller. 
- It turns out that MicroPython port for ESP32 is built on top of ESP-IDF, the official development framework for ESP32. 
  * ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework)
  * https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html#introduction

### 1. 필요한 것
- Latest version of [MicroPython port for ESP32 source code](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-esp32.git).
- Latest version of ESP-IDF.

### 2. 컴파일 순서
- compile the cross-compiler and then build the firmware by compiling code inside ports/esp32 directory including ESP-IDF.

### 3. To compile the cross-compiler
```sh
git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git
cd micropython
make -C mpy-cross
```

### 4. Compile
```sh
cd ports/esp32
```
- ESPIDF 설정
- flash port and baud 설정
```sh
ESPIDF=$IDF_PATH make -j4
```

```sh
Why can't I symlink into /usr/bin?
El Capitan's new System Integrity Protection feature prevents changes to several core parts of OS X, including most of /usr/, even by root.

How can I still add executable files to my path?
Local customizations, such as what you're doing, belong in /usr/local instead. The path /usr/local/bin doesn't exist by default, but you can create it and put custom binaries (and symlinks) in it:

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/local/bin/python2

Note that while /usr/local/bin doesn't exist by default, it is in the default PATH, so as soon as you create it, it'll be searched for commands.

```

### 5. flashing the firmware to an ESP32-based board and test the firmware
```sh
esptool.py --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART --baud 921600 write_flash --verify --flash_size=detect 0x1000 firmware.bin
```
